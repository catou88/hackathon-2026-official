# Track 1: bounded, evidence-backed RCA agent

The five-module agent is implemented in the official `track-1/starter/` runtime. It reads only whitelisted telemetry, builds replayable metric/trace/log observations, ranks bounded hypotheses, optionally asks permitted GLM models to select among those hypotheses, and deterministically renders the requested answer fields and four evidence sections. Diagnostic accuracy remains limited. The latest repair checkpoint includes an enforced Docker resource measurement and real model participation; earlier experiments below retain their original scope and limitations.

## Latest workflow repair checkpoint

The [20-case repair run](eval/results/workflow-repair-20260917/README.md) returned all 20 public-development answers, with official mean partial **0.346** and **5/20 fully solved**. All final answers retained model selections; **19/20 planned workflows completed**. One planned Strong upgrade timed out, with insufficient remaining time for its fallback, and is explicitly incomplete despite retaining a correct Flash answer.

The default CLI completed in **608.960 seconds** under Docker-enforced **2 CPUs / 8 GiB**, with read-only inputs and root filesystem. Python child peak RSS was 494,301,184 bytes; cgroup peak memory, including other container/cache usage, was 2,195,165,184 bytes. There were 36 valid responses, three timeouts and two empty responses, with no reported output-token truncation. Observed token cost was $0.113872955; three timed-out requests have unknown usage and retained reservations of $0.0306708, so total billing is not established.

This checkpoint removes repeated window scans and arbitrary trace/metric-result cutoffs, corrects candidate strength/evidence handling, and separates workflow completion from formatted-output validity. Offline discovery passed 178 tests with five real checks skipped; those five were separately run and passed. A six-transform sample from the new 4,920-record row-0 ledger replayed exactly, with all 34 sampled locators found. Full 70-case accuracy, repeated variance, a new matched single-model comparison and causal review are not established by this run. Detailed evidence, immutable runtime hashes and limitations are in the linked checkpoint.

## Submission packaging verification

The merged five-module runtime passed all **183 tests in 34.638 seconds**, including
the five real-telemetry checks with no skips. The unmodified official submission
validator passed two real cases with zero warnings. The root image built successfully
and ran two cases through the default `agents.routed` entry point under Docker-enforced
2 CPUs / 8 GiB, read-only data/root filesystem and disabled networking. Both answers
and four-section evidence files were present; this fallback smoke made zero model
requests. All 22 runtime source hashes match the preceding 20-case model experiment.
The packaging changes do not claim new accuracy or model-routing improvements.
See the [verification record](eval/results/submission-ready-20260917/README.md).

The root Dockerfile is the sole default build recipe. The separate `agentstest/`
alternative is excluded from its context and is not part of this submitted Agent.

## Actual development results

| Experiment | Planned / returned | Official mean partial | Fully solved | External elapsed | Actual model requests | Estimated cost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Deterministic integration, original IDs 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 25 | 8 / 8 | 0.1775 | 0 / 8 | 245.609 s | 0 | $0 |
| Native resource check, original IDs 0, 1 | 2 / 2 | 0.0 | 0 / 2 | 59.765 s | 0 | $0 |
| Same-agent single GLM-5.2, original IDs 6, 25 | 2 / 2 | 0.335 | 0 / 2 | 201.875 s | 2 | $0.4137852 |
| Same-agent routed, original IDs 6, 25 | 2 / 2 | 0.500 | 1 / 2 | 306.718 s | 2 | $0.019789005 |

The eight-case run used code revision `3172a081366080512261771e38ab96e3feaab6ef`. Cases were chosen as the first occurrence of each task type plus a multiple-failure case, using label-free instructions rather than development answers. This is a small public-development integration sample, not a 70-case development benchmark, independent holdout, or hidden-test result. The official evaluator was not changed. One repetition was run, so variance is unmeasured. Per-case elapsed time averaged 30.6275 seconds, median 30.975, maximum/p95 31.77; the external timer also includes startup and saving. Eight bypass events and zero actual HTTP requests establish zero runtime model cost for this deterministic run. This does not establish routing savings or model quality.

All eight original row IDs were present exactly once. There were no unexpected IDs, missing evidence files, invalid four-section layouts, or denominator exclusions. One output passed the structural validator as valid and seven were degraded because telemetry/coverage or ordering remained uncertain. Structural validity is not diagnostic correctness. The partial scores were 0.75 for original row 9, 0.67 for row 25, and zero for the other six cases. The official evaluator rounds per-case partial scores; the reported mean preserves those official values.

The two-case native resource check used code revision `9acaa72` and observed the actual Python interpreter pinned to two logical CPUs. Peak observed RSS was 261,902,336 bytes (249.77 MiB), sampled every 200 ms; an 8 GiB process-memory guard did not terminate the run. External time was 59.765 seconds. This is a native Windows measurement, not a Docker/cgroup guarantee. The earlier eight-case monitor observed a launcher rather than its interpreter child; its peak RSS and enforced CPU limits are therefore explicitly unverified and are not reported as resource acceptance.

Artifacts with actual run manifests/source hashes, generated predictions, audited case counts, and resource observations are in [`eval/results`](eval/results). Raw telemetry and full structured ledgers are deliberately excluded. Later correctness fixes to audit/replay/rendering do not retroactively change the frozen runtime source revision of either experiment.

## Limited authenticated comparison

The user authorized at most two short provider probes, then one single-model and one routed run on original IDs 6 and 25. Both configurations used frozen revision `7bc31e71d0b02aa44bef5c7da004dee68fa4f62b`, the same tools, case order, source hashes, dataset identity, official price table and budget policy. Single-model pinned GLM-5.2; routed selected GLM-4.7-Flash. Both completed both planned cases with valid row/evidence integrity. The one sequential, single-model-first repetition leaves variance and operating-system cache effects uncontrolled; these are public development cases, not an independent holdout.

There were **six real HTTP attempts in total**: two probes and four case requests, below the authorized maximum of 18. The GLM-4.7-Flash probe returned token usage but empty content; the GLM-5.3-Flash probe succeeded. Both probe costs count, totaling $0.000049875. Including probes, observed usage was 579,360 input and 4,386 output tokens, with **$0.43362408 estimated total cost** and no unknown-usage calls. Costs apply the frozen official Track 1 prices to provider-reported usage; they are not an account billing receipt. The probe requests are separate from each configuration's RCA accuracy and latency, and took 6.203 seconds combined. Credentials were supplied only through the process environment and were not saved with artifacts.

Three of the four case responses had empty content, including **both routed responses**. The single-model arm accepted one candidate-selection response. Routed answers therefore came entirely from deterministic fallback: its higher score cannot be attributed to useful model reasoning or successful escalation. Neither arm exercised cross-model fallback or a strong-stage request, because model requests consumed the remaining case time. Time-bounded telemetry can also retain different scan prefixes across runs. The cost figures describe this sample; they do not establish general routing savings at equal quality.

The four prompts contained 143,437–146,240 provider input tokens. Requests lasted 68.860–129.297 seconds despite a configured request timeout of at most 20 seconds; case times were 97.37–157.89 seconds, exceeding the 45-second internal soft target. These observations showed that the SDK inactivity timeout was insufficient as an absolute request deadline and that per-field prompt truncation was insufficient as a total-size bound. Subsequent corrections are verified separately below; their effects are not credited to this frozen paid run. Compact manifests, scores, predictions, routes, usage and inclusive spending are saved in [`eval/results/glm-smoke-20260917`](eval/results/glm-smoke-20260917). Raw development-answer strings are removed from exported audit summaries.

## Evidence audit

The saved structured ledger for original row 0 of the eight-case run contains 1,704 unique records. The audit verified that its four referenced telemetry files exist and that decision/alternative references have no dangling evidence IDs. Using a disclosed deterministic sample—first evidence ID in lexicographic order within each transform—it replayed six records: metric baseline, metric replica/node comparison, service summary, trace group, trace pairing quality, and network start-gap comparison. All six numeric replays matched, and all 34 sampled source locators were found. This is six sampled aggregate checks, not a claim that all 1,704 aggregates were replayed. Physical units remain `native/unknown` when undocumented. Causal support was not independently reviewed by a human.

The metric module independently recovered the documented row-0 read-activity change from telemetry: a last normal sample at 09:08, first sustained change at 09:09, and peak at 09:10 UTC+8. That observation did not make the final deterministic diagnosis correct. It illustrates the remaining gap between candidate recall and causal ranking. Component names, values and example times are not detection constants.

Each evidence record stores query definitions, source paths, original record locators, transform version/parameters, measured values, units, coverage and limitations. Partial scans record their retained input prefix, so replay uses the same records. The human evidence display contains every referenced ID, bounded supplementary observations and explicit omission counts; full structured JSON remains under the run output's `diagnostics/evidence/`. Re-rendering the real row-0 ledger with the compact display produced 41,825 UTF-8 bytes and 19 displayed evidence records, with unchanged structural validity.

## Method and failure behavior

- **M1:** shared UTC+8 contracts, instruction parsing, incremental component catalog, bounded provenance-preserving CSV scans, runtime state, official runner integration and packaging.
- **M2:** container/node coverage independent of service shortlist, robust and zero-MAD comparisons, sampled onset intervals, short spikes, multiple episodes, replica/node comparisons and replay. Gauge/counter semantics are not guessed; the verified-counter registry is empty until semantics are confirmed.
- **M3:** independent span-group anomalies, duplicate/parent-aware pairing, safe start-gap features, targeted literal log patterns and replay. Trace duration remains in native units and dependency direction is not causal proof.
- **M4:** bounded investigation, correlated-evidence deduplication, episode selection, deterministic best guess, allowed-GLM routing, cross-case circuit breakers, bounded retries/fallback, per-attempt routes and observed usage. Single-model mode forbids cross-model fallback. Missing provider usage remains unknown and keeps a conservative budget reservation.
- **M5:** stateless requested-field/count/layer/reference validation, deterministic four-section evidence, exact original-row denominator audit, isolated experiment manifests, same-agent comparisons and source/replay checks.

Missing, empty, partial, failed and unqueried coverage never means healthy. Every case retains a best guess; doubts belong in evidence. The validator distinguishes malformed/contradicted answers from unknown catalog coverage. Development labels are used only by the offline evaluator. Real source data is never used as an answer lookup table.

The measured diagnostic failures remain substantial. Generic resource changes can outrank the causal component; correlated CPU, memory and I/O changes are difficult to separate. Weak network hints cannot establish packet-loss/corruption/retransmission subtypes. Missing reference samples, sparse traces, partial scans and ambiguous episode separation reduce reliability. The earlier 512-series metric evidence cutoff was removed in the repair checkpoint; the explicit model shortlist still limits which alternatives receive model review. The report does not infer a general accuracy increase from two windows or compare this eight-case result with the official heuristic's different 70-case denominator.

## Evaluation and remaining acceptance

The offline harness freezes original IDs/order, source hashes, resolved runtime budgets, price table, data identity, cache conditions, repetition and resource conditions before execution. It creates separate directories and strips scoring fields from runner input. `audit_run` uses the unchanged official matching, keeps missing cases in the planned denominator, marks duplicate/unexpected predictions invalid, counts every usage attempt, and separates external elapsed time from summed case time. It never converts absent token measurements to zero dollars. `compare_runs` rejects unsupported savings claims when conditions differ, pricing is incomplete, or either routed/single-model side made no actual calls.

M5's 28 synthetic tests cover output field combinations, invalid/degraded rules, finite evidence, immutable rendering, missing/duplicate/unexpected cases, noncontinuous IDs, repeated usage, missing provider tokens, unpriced models, resume mappings, dry-run label stripping, comparison fairness and source replay. CLI help and a two-repetition real-query dry-run were executed with no model calls and no experiment directory created. The coordinating integration tests exercise the modules together and provider failures through local stubs; these are not real-provider quality measurements.

At revision `7bc31e7`, the complete integration suite **passed 125 tests in 74.600 seconds, including five real-data checks and no skipped tests**. This includes both operational-bypass disclosure regressions. Its real trace check explicitly returned partial coverage under its 30-second budget; a passing bounded-runtime test does not make that scan complete. The official submission validator also completed **two real cases with zero warnings**, confirming the required predictions/evidence shape. Those validator results do not establish diagnostic correctness or replace the development accuracy results above. Actual OpenAI-compatible SDK transport tests against localhost verified HTTP-200 error fallback and disabled hidden SDK retries; they made no external paid API calls. Sanitized transcripts, including the earlier 123-test run, are saved in [`eval/results/verification`](eval/results/verification).

These counts describe the stated completed verification revision, before the corrections motivated by the paid experiment.

The correction in runtime revision `cf3c4b5` replaces the production SDK call with a standard-library OpenAI-compatible HTTP worker. The parent enforces an absolute monotonic deadline covering worker startup and network activity, then terminates and reaps the direct interpreter process; it does not leave a local background request running. Redirects are refused and response reads are capped at 262,144 bytes. An interrupted request can still incur remote charges, so missing provider usage remains unknown with its budget reservation retained. Startup failures before the request marker are distinguished from attempted HTTP calls. The final integrated suite then **passed all 133 tests in 74.747 seconds, including all five real-data checks, with no skips**. The transcript is [`final-full-tests-133.txt`](eval/results/verification/final-full-tests-133.txt).

Serialized model messages now have a global limit of **48,000 UTF-8 bytes**, with candidate IDs, genuine displayed support IDs, and explicit omission information. The complete local evidence ledger is unchanged. Local HTTP regression tests cover a trickling response that stays below the inactivity timeout but exceeds the total deadline, worker startup stalling, HTTP failures, and unknown-usage accounting. The new eight prompt/transport tests also passed independent review and execution. Two offline reconstructions of saved decision shortlists retained all 12 original offered candidate IDs each while staying below the cap; they are not exact replays of the original full prompts because those candidate features were not persisted. See [`tests/m4/TRANSPORT_CHECK.md`](track-1/starter/tests/m4/TRANSPORT_CHECK.md). No further paid calls were made to test this correction, so its real-provider accuracy and latency remain unmeasured.

Still unmeasured:

- Repeat variance and broader matched routing quality/cost tradeoffs. The later 20-case repair run is not a rerun of the historical two-case comparison.
- Complete workflow acceptance: Docker 2 CPU / 8 GB measurement now exists, but the repair checkpoint still has one unfinished Strong escalation.
- Full 70-case development accuracy, held-out deployment accuracy, calibrated confidence and causal explanation review.

Reproduce the comparison plan with `python eval/run_comparison.py --help` and the dry-run command in [`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md). Actual model runs require the supplied Featherless endpoint/key and a new output directory. The small measured cost difference above is not a general routing-savings claim.

## AI and source disclosure

Implementation and tests were generated and reviewed with OpenAI Codex using a GPT-6-family coding assistant and delegated subagents in isolated Git worktrees. No additional agent framework was introduced. The human provided the project objective, module boundaries and repository constraints; Codex performed the implementation, debugging, test execution and report assembly. Exact Codex model variant and per-assistant token/cost accounting were not exposed in the saved experiment manifests, so they are not claimed as measured usage.

The official starter supplied the runner interface, output formatter, model price table, heuristic baseline and unchanged OpenRCA evaluator. The new modules, routing logic, deterministic evidence validation and offline audit harness are team additions. Runtime model options are the allowed Featherless GLM family documented in Track 1; none were called in the reported deterministic experiments. Data attribution and licensing remain in the official repository's attribution files. AI-assistant development activity is distinct from the runtime usage ledger and is not counted as Featherless inference spending.
